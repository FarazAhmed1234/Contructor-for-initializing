# Contructor-for-initializing
Create a class named ‘Faculty’ having two variables ‘name’ and ‘designation’ respectively.
Assign the value of designation as ‘Permanent Faculty’ or ‘Visiting Faculty’ and that of
name as “Xyz” by creating an object of the class ‘Faculty’. Also make a Contructor for
initializing the class. Print the values in the int main() function.
